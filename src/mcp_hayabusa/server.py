    """Run a Hayabusa detection scan over Windows Event Log (.evtx) data.

    Wraps `hayabusa csv-timeline` / `hayabusa json-timeline`, always run
    non-interactively (no rule-config wizard, no launch banner).

    Args:
        target: Path to a single .evtx file (set is_file=True) or a
            directory containing .evtx files.
        is_file: True if `target` is a single .evtx file rather than a
            directory.
        output_format: "csv" (uses csv-timeline), or "json"/"jsonl"
            (both use json-timeline; jsonl adds Hayabusa's -L flag). This
            controls Hayabusa's own output format, not the shape of the
            dict returned by this tool — see result_detail for that.
        rules_dir: Optional path to a custom Sigma/Hayabusa rules
            directory or file (passed as -r). Defaults to Hayabusa's
            bundled ./rules. Ignored if rule_filter is set (see below).
        rule_filter: Only run rules whose rule file text contains this
            string (case-insensitive), e.g. "lateral" or "mimikatz".
            Hayabusa has no native free-text rule filter, so this copies
            matching rule files from rules_dir (or Hayabusa's default
            ./rules) into a temporary rules directory and scans with just
            those loaded.
        min_level: Optional minimum alert level to load: "informational",
            "low", "medium", "high", or "critical" (passed as -m).
        utc: Output timestamps in UTC instead of local time (-U).
        output_path: Where to write the full result file. If omitted, a
            temporary file is used and deleted after a preview is
            extracted, so the full result set is only kept on disk when
            you pass this explicitly.
        result_detail: "summary" (default) returns counts by level, the
            top matching rules, and a condensed preview (key fields only);
            stdout/stderr tails are only included on non-zero exit. "full"
            returns the complete record preview with all fields plus
            stdout/stderr tails, as before.
        max_results: Cap on the number of preview records returned
            (default 20). Does not affect record_count, which is always
            the true total.

    Returns:
        A dict shaped per result_detail; see above.
